All repositories in this directory were added with `git-subtree`. Take some time to familiarize yourself with `git-subtree` before making changes here. [This blog](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree/) is a good place to start.

The repositories were subtreed from the following locations:

* bashsteps: https://github.com/axsh/bashsteps
* mount-partition: https://github.com/triggers/mount-partition
